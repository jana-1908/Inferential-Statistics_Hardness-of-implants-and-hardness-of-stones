Brinell Hardness Analysis for Zingaro Stone Printing

image

Brinell's hardness is a unit of measurement that indicates the hardness of a material. Zingaro stone printing seeks to assess the Brinell hardness of both polished and unpolished stones to determine suitable materials for printing images or patterns.

Background

Brinell's hardness is a unit of measurement that indicates the hardness of a material. Zingaro stone printing seeks to assess the Brinell hardness of both polished and unpolished stones to determine suitable materials for printing images or patterns.

Objective

To derive conclusions regarding the Brinell's hardness of both polished and unpolished stones and how they vary or align with each other

Conclusion

The mean Brinell's hardness index of unpolished stones and polished stones are found to be 134.11 and 147.79 respectively from the statistical summary, which supports the p-value.
The p-value is lesser than the level of significance, suggesting that we have enough significance to conclude that the mean Brinell's hardness index of polished stones is not equal to the mean Brinell's hardness index of unpolished stones.
With the above two evidences, we can conclude that mean hardness of the polished stones is higher than the mean hardness of the unpolished stones.
